# Minimals-Overview-Using-React JS

A collaborative React JS implementation of Minimals.cc dashboard interfaces using Vite. This project recreates the clean, minimalist UI/UX of the original Minimals dashboard while demonstrating modern React development practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to recreate three key dashboards from the Minimals.cc template:
- Main Dashboard (https://minimals.cc/dashboard)
- Booking Dashboard (https://minimals.cc/dashboard/booking)
- Course Dashboard (https://minimals.cc/dashboard/course)

Our team of three developers is working together to implement these dashboards with a focus on component reusability, responsive design, and modern React patterns.
